# Heavy Impact Rain Predictor  

The Heavy Impact Rain Predictor is a machine learning-driven project designed to forecast heavy rainfall events using historical and real-time weather data. With climate change leading to more unpredictable weather patterns, accurate rainfall prediction is crucial for disaster management, agriculture, urban planning, and public safety. This project utilizes the Random Forest algorithm a powerful ensemble learning method known for its accuracy and robustness in handling large datasets with multiple features. The model is trained on a dataset containing key meteorological parameters, including latitude, longitude, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and date-time, allowing it to make precise predictions for varying locations across India. The dataset specifically covers states like Kerala, Maharashtra, Jammu and Kashmir, Delhi, Rajasthan, and Nagaland, ensuring diversity in geographical and climatic conditions for better generalization of the model. One of the core challenges of the project is to achieve high prediction accuracy while keeping computational requirements low, making it suitable for real-time applications even on resource-constrained devices. By providing timely and reliable heavy rainfall predictions, this system can be integrated into early warning mechanisms, helping local authorities and communities take proactive measures to mitigate the risks associated with extreme weather events. The project is open-source and encourages collaboration, aiming to refine the model further with real-world data and advanced feature engineering techniques.
